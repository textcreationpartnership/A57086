            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His firſt Maſter was <hi>Adam Van Noort,</hi> one of ſo ill a temper, that <hi>Rubens</hi> was forced to leave him, and betake himſelf to <hi>Octavio Venus,</hi> by whoſe good Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having attained perfection in his Art; he traviled at 23 years of age to <hi>Italy,</hi> where he lived 7 years in the ſervice of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by whom he was employed in ſeveral Embaſſies, amongſt others to <hi>Rome,</hi> to copy ſome Pieces of the moſt famous Maſters before him, wherein he ſo exactly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Originals, that his Copies were exceedingly admired.

Henry Frederick</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the year 1642, and his Son, Prince <hi>William</hi> employed him, in their Service for ſeveral years, in which time he made thoſe excellent Pieces, which were to be ſeen at the ſaid Princes Palace at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Holland.</hi> He Painted moſt Perſons of Quality, that were then living. That great Piece of his, is moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he repreſents <hi>Mars</hi> the God of War, on one fide, ſtirred up, and provoked by the Furies; on the other hand, Peace and concord ſtriving gently to appeaſe and reſtraine him, among the Figures is a naked woman, whoſe fleſh ſeems, ſo natural, ſo ſoft and lively, that the Hand is apt to be deceived by the Eye, into an endeavour to feell that which ſeems to be <hi>real Fleſh,</hi> The <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of St <hi>George</hi> in the great Church is alſo an admirable Piece. He died in the Flower of his Age and his loſs was much lamented.</p>

                  <p>Was the Son of a rich Merchant at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> born in the year 1546. He diſcovered his firſt Inclination to painting by drawing ſeveral figures when young in the Book of his fathers Accounts, which though his father, was very angry at, when he firſt ſaw it, yet diſcovering thereby the bent of <hi>his</hi> Inclination, he ſent him to a Painter to be inſtructed, by which means and his earneſt conſidering the paintings of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and alſo by accuſtoming himſelf to reading <hi>Poetry</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at length a very able Painter. After he had ſpent ſome time in <hi>France</hi> in thus employing his Talent, he paſſed the <hi>Alpes</hi> and continued for a while at <hi>Milan:</hi> There it was that he invented and drew in the ruines of an old Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, A <hi>Dance of Witches</hi> which procured him ſo much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Don Clavio</hi> having bought it and ſhown it to <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Farneſe;</hi> the Cardinal was ſo taken with it, that he offered a very honourable Allowance to <hi>Spranger,</hi> to draw him to <hi>Caprarole,</hi> that his ſtately <hi>Palace</hi> there, might be adorned with ſo curious a pencil. But <hi>Spranger</hi> having a mind to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> ſteered his courſe thither, and not long after his arrival there was made Painter to the Pope, and had a ſumptuous lodging aſſigned him in the <hi>Belveder</hi> over the <hi>Laecoon:</hi> Being thus raiſed to honour, he raiſed his mind to attempt ſomething worthy of his fortune, and in this noble heat of Spirit, he paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that rare <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>the laſt Judgment,</hi> upon a large Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of ſix foot in wideneſs, where there are five hundred figures perfectly diverſified, and diſpoſed after a moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order and deſign, The Pope dying a little after this Piece was finiſhed, it was placed near his Sepulchre for a perpetual ornament thereto, and to preſerve the memory both of the Pope and of the Painter together: After this he went into the ſervice of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian the ſecond,</hi> and after his death, he was entertained by his Succeſſor <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an honourable Penſion. While he was in this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſervice he painted for him a curious Piece of <hi>Mercury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing</hi> Pſyche <hi>into the Councel of the Gods:</hi> And another upon Copper repreſenting <hi>The City of</hi> Rome, <hi>under the figure of a Woman with the</hi> Tyber, <hi>and upon the borders of the River, a Wolfe giving ſuck to the two young twins Remus and Romulus.</hi> He had one extraordinary faculty, namely ſo retentive a Memory that it faithfully preſerved the true <hi>Jdeas</hi> of au object though he had but once beheld it, by means whereof though he had omitted to draw or deſign the rarities of Rome when he was there, yet he made uſe of ſeveral of them in embeliſhing his moſt magnificent Pieces: A certain Gentleman who had a great affection for a beautiful Lady that belonged to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Arembergh,</hi> and being but ſeldom able to get a view of her, intreated him earneſtly to draw her picture, which he did, after he had ſeen her but once, with ſuch exactneſs that reſembled every feature to the life, to the no ſmall ſatisfaction of the admiring Lover The Emperor keeping his Court at Prague, <hi>Spranger</hi> ſetled there alſo, and married a wife the daughter of a rich Merchant, hoping to have Children that might inherit the great wealth he got by his painting, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he enlarged his Houſe with a ſtately Front and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning it to be a place for entertainment of the Arts, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliſhed the out ſide thereof and the Porch with divers great Figures as big as the life. The Emperor being jealous of his working for others, commanded him to paint for none but himſelfe, and thereupon ſent for him to his own Palace, where he took ſuch extraordinary delight in the inimitable ſtrokes of his pencill that he would ſtand by him ſometimes for hours together, to ſee him paint; and to ſhow how greatly he admired the Excellency of his Art, at a ſolemn Feaſt, in preſence of his <hi>Courtiers</hi> he with his own hand preſented him a Gold Chaine and a Medall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a publick <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>the States</hi> of the <hi>Empire;</hi> honoured him and his Poſterity with the Title of <hi>Nobility:</hi> Though his pieces are ſcarce any where to be ſeen but in the Emperors Cloſet, yet the ingenious <hi>Goltzius</hi> has graven and publiſhed divers of them in <hi>Prints,</hi> among others that incomparable piece of <hi>the Banquet of the Gods at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Pſyche:</hi> And <hi>Cupid and Pſyche</hi> out of <hi>Apuletus:</hi> After he had got permiſſion in his old age to retire from Court he painted for a friend, of his an admirable piece of <hi>
